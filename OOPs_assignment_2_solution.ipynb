    "ANSWER] The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides a way to define abstract classes and enforce the creation of certain methods in derived classes, ensuring a certain level of structure and consistency in your code. Abstract base classes are classes that are meant to be subclassed by other classes and provide a blueprint for the behavior and structure that the subclasses should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used for several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Abstract Base Classes: You can use the abc module to create abstract base classes. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated itself, but it defines a set of methods that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing Method Implementation: Abstract base classes can define abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator. Subclasses must then provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods, ensuring that certain behavior is present across all subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type Checking and Polymorphism: Abstract base classes can be used to establish a common interface for a group of related classes. This can be useful for type checking and polymorphism, allowing you to treat objects of different concrete subclasses as instances of the common abstract base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Documentation: Abstract base classes can serve as documentation, indicating to other programmers what methods are expected to be implemented by subclasses and what behavior those methods should exhibit.\n",

    "ANSWER]Data abstraction is achieved in programming through abstract data types (ADTs) and encapsulation. Abstract data types define high-level data structures and operations, while encapsulation hides implementation details and provides controlled access through methods. This allows you to work with data at a higher level, focusing on what the data does rather than how it's implemented."
